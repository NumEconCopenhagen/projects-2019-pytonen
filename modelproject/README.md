# Modelproject

## Description

Our project seeks to model a consumer's optimal consumption bundle given a utility function, an income and the prices of two goods. We follow an example from the ordinary winter exam 2016 in Microeconics 1.

We determine the optimal consumption bundles for a consumer for various prices algebraically and numerically.
