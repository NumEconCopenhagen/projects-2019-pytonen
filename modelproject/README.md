# Modelproject

## Description

Our project seeks to model a consumer's optimal consumption bundle given a utility function, an income and the prices of two goods. We follow an example from the ordinary winter exam 2016 in Microeconomics 1. We determine the optimal consumption bundles for a consumer for various prices algebraically and numerically.

For the solution where both prices are 1 and the consumer's income is 16, we instead let a social planner distribute 7 of good 1 and 9 of good 2 between two consumers according to a social utility function that focuses on distributing equally.
