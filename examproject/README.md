## 1. Human capital accumulation
This assignment seeks to investigate a consumers choice between working or not, dependent on the level of human capital she receives from working. We investigate her behavior when she maximizes her value of life in two periods and conclude at which level of human capital she decides to work in both periods. This is visualized by line charts.

## 2. AS-AD model
For the second assignment we consider an AS-AD model and how a positive demand shock with different properties effects output and inflation over time. Also we investigated the statistics of variance, autocorrelation and correlation between output and inflation. Especially we investigate how the correlation between output and inflation are influenced by how much expectation to inflation rely on the expecations of the prior period rather than the actual inflation in the prior period.

## 3. Exchange Economy
We seek to determine consumer behavior given exponentially and later equally distributed endowments. We plot budget shares for each agent, plot excess demand functions for good 1 and 2, find Walras-equilibirum prices for good 1 and 2 and plot the distribution of utility for the Walras-equilibrum.
