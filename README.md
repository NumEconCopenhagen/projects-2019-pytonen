# Pytonen portfolio

Our portfolio consists of our data project, our model project and our solutions to the three questions given for the exam. 


## Data project
In our data analysis project, we conduct a graphical analysis to explore the differences in the employment shares between the five regions and the general level for Denmark. Furthermore we investigate the differences in employment between men and women.

## Model project
Our model project seeks to determine the optimal consumption for a consumer given the consumer's budget constraint and utility function according to assignment 2 in the Microeconomics I exam from December 19th 2016. We find an optimal bundle for a given price and income relationship. This bundle is then divided to two consumers by a social planner.
