Our data project seeks to explore the differences in the employment rate between the five regions in Denmark and compare it with the overall employment share in Denmark. We show the differences in employment shares in a line chart. The code is documented through out to maintain oversight.

The main conclusion of the analysis is, that the delevopment of the employment shares follows the same pattern throughout all Regions of Denmark. All Regions were noticeably influenced by the Financial Crisis in 2008-2009 where the employment shares fell in all Regions. Yet as shown in the line charts Region Midtjylland in general has a higher level of employment whereas Region Nordjylland seems to have the most volatile development of the Regions.
