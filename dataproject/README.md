# Dataproject

Our data project seeks to explore the differences in the employment shares across gender and across the five regions of Denmark. We display the development of emplyment shares across regions by both a simple line chart and an interactive linechart that allows the reader to change which region to investigate. Also we differences between genders are displayed by a stacked bar chart and an interactive line chart across regions. The code is documented throughout to maintain oversight.

The data used in our project can be found here: https://www.statistikbanken.dk/RAS201

## Conclusion
The main conclusion of the analysis is, that the development of the employment shares follows the same pattern throughout all Regions of Denmark. All Regions were noticeably influenced by the Financial Crisis in 2008-2009 where the employment shares fell in all Regions. Yet as shown in the line charts Region Midtjylland in general has a higher level of employment whereas Region Nordjylland seems to have the most volatile development of the Regions.
Further it seem that the evolution is more volatile for men than for women, which could be explained by the fact that men in general have jobs more sensitive to changes in business cycles than women.
