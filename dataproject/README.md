# Dataproject

Our data project seeks to explore the differences in the employment shares across gender and across the five regions of Denmark. We display the development of emplyment shares across regions by both a simple line chart and an interactive linechart that allows the reader to change which region to investigate. 
Also the differences between genders are displayed by a stacked bar chart and an interactive line chart across regions. The code is documented throughout to maintain oversight.

The data used in our project can be found here: https://www.statistikbanken.dk/RAS201

## Conclusion
From the analysis on the regional level it can be concluded that the delevopment of the employment shares follows the same pattern throughout all regions of Denmark. The employment in Denmark was noticeably influenced by the financial crisis in 2008-2009. Region Midtjylland has an overall employment share that is higher compared to ther regions. 
In 2012 it is very clear that the employment rose in all regions, the employment share has been rising in all regions until 2016 where it felt a little. 

Looking at the employment shares for men and women it can be seen from our visualizations that the employment for men is more volatile than for women. This might be explained by the fact that men in general have jobs that are more sensitive to changes in business cycles than women.
